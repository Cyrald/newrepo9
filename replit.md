## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Routing:**
- React 18 with TypeScript, utilizing Wouter for client-side routing.
- Single Page Application (SPA) with `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` for code splitting.
- Intelligent prefetching system adaptively loads pages based on user authentication status and internet quality.

**UI & Styling:**
- Shadcn UI component library and Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach.
- Custom color palette (green, beige, gold accents) with a mobile-first responsive design.
- Typography uses Open Sans for body text and Playfair Display/Lora for headings.
- Supports light and dark modes.

**State Management:**
- Zustand manages global application state.
- TanStack Query (React Query v5) handles server state management and caching.
- React Hook Form with Zod validation is used for form handling.

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:**
- Node.js with Express.js, developed in TypeScript for type safety.
- RESTful API endpoints are structured under `/api`.

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Session-based authentication with a PostgreSQL session store.
- `bcrypt` for secure password hashing.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented via middleware, supporting Customer, Consultant, Marketer, and Admin roles.
- All authorization checks are strictly enforced on the backend.

**File Upload:**
- `Multer` middleware handles `multipart/form-data` for uploading product images and chat attachments.
- Files are stored in the `/uploads` directory, supporting JPEG, PNG, and WEBP formats.

**Real-time Communication:**
- A WebSocket server (`ws` library) facilitates real-time notifications for the support chat.
- WebSocket connections are used exclusively for notifications; message persistence is handled via the REST API.
- Targeted broadcast ensures notifications are sent only to relevant conversation participants.

### Data Storage Solutions

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL serves as the primary database, with Neon serverless PostgreSQL used for cloud deployment.
- Drizzle ORM provides type-safe queries and manages database migrations.

**Schema Design:**
- The database schema is comprehensive, covering Users, Roles, Products, Categories, Orders, Cart, Wishlist, Support Messages, Payment Cards, and Addresses.
- Features include UUID primary keys, timestamps, soft delete patterns, and optimized indexing.

### Business Logic

**Bonus System:**
- New users receive an initial bonus.
- Cashback rates are tiered based on order value.
- Bonuses are not combinable with promocodes.
- A maximum percentage of an order can be paid with bonuses.

**Promocode System:**
- Supports percentage-based discounts with configurable minimum/maximum order amounts.
- Includes expiration dates, usage limits, and active/inactive statuses.
- Promocode normalization to uppercase.

**Order Processing:**
- A multi-step checkout process includes address, delivery, payment, and confirmation.
- Integrations with delivery services for cost calculation.
- Supports multiple payment methods and order status tracking.

**Support Chat System:**
- Features a customer-facing widget with privacy consent (stored locally).
- An admin interface displays active conversations and customer information.
- Real-time message delivery is enabled via WebSocket notifications.
- A REST API handles message persistence with role-based access control.
- An auto-select feature for the first conversation in the admin interface.
- Includes a dedicated privacy policy page detailing the consent flow.

## Recent Changes

### 2024-11-23: Three-Tier Support Chat System Implementation

**Database Schema Updates:**
- ✅ Modified `supportConversations` table: changed `status` from boolean to enum ('open' | 'archived' | 'closed')

- ✅ Added `closedAt` timestamp field for tracking when chats are permanently closed
- ✅ Added `lastMessageAt` timestamp field for sorting conversations by recency
- ✅ Added `archivedAt` timestamp field for archival tracking

**Backend Storage Functions (server/storage.ts):**
- ✅ `getOrCreateConversation()`: Auto-reopens archived conversations when user sends message; creates new if closed
- ✅ `getActiveConversation()`: Returns active (open or archived) conversation for a user
- ✅ `getConversationStatus()`: Retrieves current status of user's conversation
- ✅ `archiveConversation()`: Transitions conversation from 'open' to 'archived'
- ✅ `closeConversation()`: Transitions conversation to 'closed' (permanent, complies with 152-ФЗ)
- ✅ `reopenConversation()`: Reopens archived conversations back to 'open' status
- ✅ `updateLastMessageTime()`: Updates lastMessageAt timestamp
- ✅ `searchClosedConversations()`: Full-text search of closed conversations by email/date range
- ✅ `getAllSupportConversations()`: Returns conversations filtered by status, sorted by lastMessageAt

- ✅ WebSocket notifications for conversation state changes

**Admin Panel (client/src/pages/admin/support-chat-page.tsx):**
- ✅ Added 3 tabs: "Открытые" (Open) | "Архив" (Archived) | "Закрытые" (Closed)
- ✅ Compacted UI: all sizes ~20% smaller, no page-level scrollbars
- ✅ Search interface for closed conversations (email + date range filters)
- ✅ Removed unread message counter from chat list
- ✅ Context-sensitive action buttons per status:
  - Open: Archive | Close buttons
  - Archived: Reopen | Close buttons
  - Closed: Display-only, no input area, "stored per 152-ФЗ" message
- ✅ Status change notifications via WebSocket

**Customer Chat Widget (client/src/components/support-chat-widget.tsx):**
- ✅ Fetches conversation status on load and every 5 seconds
- ✅ If status is 'closed': shows "Chat closed, start new" screen instead of messages
- ✅ Input area hidden for closed conversations

- ✅ Removed `toggleChat()` function, simplified to direct `openChat()` call

### 2024-11-20: UX Improvements - Cart Badge, Quantity Controls & Fixed Positioning

**Cart Badge Positioning:**
- ✅ Moved cart badge closer to icon: changed from `-right-1.5 -top-1.5` to `-right-0 -top-0` (~6px closer)

**Product Card Quantity Controls:**
- ✅ Replaced static "В корзине: X из Y" text with interactive controls
- ✅ Added compact inline quantity editor with -, input field, + buttons
