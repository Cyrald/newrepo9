# Natural Products E-Commerce Platform

## Overview

This is a full-featured e-commerce platform for natural and organic products, built as a React SPA with a Node.js/Express backend. The application serves customers shopping for natural products while providing comprehensive admin tools for product management, order processing, and customer support.

The platform implements a role-based access control system supporting administrators, marketers, consultants, and customers. It integrates with third-party services for payments (YooKassa), delivery (CDEK, Boxberry), and email verification.

- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- Single Page Application (SPA) architecture

**UI & Styling:**
- Shadcn UI component library for consistent design system
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Custom color palette: green (primary), beige, and gold accents
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- Typography: Open Sans (body), Playfair Display/Lora (serif headings)

**State Management:**

- Nodemailer for sending verification emails

**Authorization Roles:**
1. **Customer** - Default role for registered users
2. **Consultant** - Access to support chat only
3. **Marketer** - Product, category, promotion management
4. **Admin** - Full system access including user management

- Bonuses cannot be earned when using promocodes or existing bonuses
- Maximum 20% of order can be paid with bonuses

**Promocode System:**
- Percentage-based discounts
- Minimum/maximum order amount restrictions
- Expiration dates
- Usage limits per user
- Active/inactive status toggle
- Uppercase code normalization

**Order Processing:**
- Multi-step checkout: address → delivery → payment → confirmation

### Phase 1: Basic Frontend-Backend Integration (November 15, 2025) ✅

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive API client layer (`client/src/lib/api.ts`) with typed request functions for all endpoints
- ✅ Implemented Zustand stores for global state:
  - `authStore.ts` - User authentication state, token management, login/logout
  - `cartStore.ts` - Shopping cart state with safe total calculations
- ✅ Created React Query hooks for server state management:
  - `useAuth.ts` - Authentication queries and mutations
  - `useCategories.ts` - Category data fetching
  - `useProducts.ts` - Product listing with filters and search
  - `useCart.ts` - Cart operations with authentication guards
- ✅ Integrated authentication pages with real API:
  - Login page with email/password validation
  - Registration page with form validation
  - Email verification page with token handling
- ✅ Integrated main user-facing pages with data fetching:
  - Home page with featured products and categories
  - Catalog page with filtering and search
  - Product detail page with add-to-cart
  - Cart page with quantity updates and totals
- ✅ Created `CartItemWithProduct` DTO type for proper cart data structure
- ✅ Backend enhancement: `getCartItems()` returns product data via JOIN with decimal normalization
- ✅ Frontend safety: Cart calculations handle null products, invalid prices, NaN values
- ✅ TypeScript type safety: Full end-to-end type checking between server and client
- ✅ Development workflow running successfully on port 5000

**Technical Achievements:**
- Type-safe API layer with proper error handling (ApiError class)
- Server/client data contract with CartItemWithProduct DTO
- Decimal field normalization (PostgreSQL decimal → string → number parsing)
- Authentication guards preventing queries when logged out
- Safe cart totals with null/NaN/negative price handling
- Auto-clearing cart on authentication errors

**Design Decisions:**
- Zustand for global UI state (lightweight, simple API)
- React Query for server state (caching, auto-refetch, optimistic updates)
- Shadcn UI components for consistent design system
- Form validation with React Hook Form + Zod
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage with auto-logout on 401

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 2: Advanced Features & User Experience
  - Protected routes component for authenticated pages
  - Header integration with real user data and cart count
  - Checkout flow (delivery selection, payment integration)
  - Admin panel pages (product management, order processing)
  - Support chat UI with WebSocket integration
- Phase 3: Polish & Production Readiness
  - Error boundaries and loading states
  - Responsive design improvements
  - Performance optimization
  - Integration tests
  - Deployment configuration
